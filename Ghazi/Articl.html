 Euler  15 April 1707 â€“ 18 September 1783) was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician
 and engineer who founded the studies of graph theory and topology and made pioneering and influential discoveries in many
 other branches of mathematics such as analytic number theory, complex analysis, and infinitesimal calculus.
 He introduced much of modern mathematical terminology and notation, including the notion of a mathematical function.
 He is also known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy and music theory.
 Euler's formula, named after Leonhard Euler, is a mathematical formula in complex analysis that establishes the fundamental
 relationship between the trigonometric functions and the complex exponential function. 
 where e is the base of the natural logarithm, i is the imaginary unit, and cos and sin are the trigonometric functions
 cosine and sine respectively. This complex exponential function is sometimes denoted cis x ("cosine plus i sine"). 
 The formula is still valid if x is a complex number, and so some authors refer to the more general complex version 
 as Euler's formula</pre></p></div>
