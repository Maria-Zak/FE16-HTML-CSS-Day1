 Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial 
 proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state 
 of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the 
 heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics lacking 
 in classical mechanics.Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed 
 on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles
 is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis
 then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives 
 rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an irreversible wave function 
 collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled
 system as a whole.Such phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and 
 several papers by Erwin Schrödinger shortly thereafter,[2][3] describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein 
 and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it
 as "spooky action at a distance")[4] and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete. 
 Later, however, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics were verified[5][6][7] in tests where polarization or spin
 of entangled particles was measured at separate locations, statistically violating Bell's inequality. In earlier tests, it couldn't 
 be ruled out that the result at one point could have been subtly transmitted to the remote point, affecting the outcome at the second
 location.[7] However, so-called "loophole-free" Bell tests have been performed where the locations were sufficiently separated that 
 communications at the speed of light would have taken longer—in one case, 10,000 times longer—than the interval between the measurement
 ccording to some interpretations of quantum mechanics, the effect of one measurement occurs instantly. Other interpretations which 
 don't recognize wavefunction collapse dispute that there is any "effect" at all. However, all interpretations agree that entanglement 
 produces correlation between the measurements and that the mutual information between the entangled particles can be exploited, but 
 that any transmission of information at faster-than-light speeds is impossible.Quantum entanglement has been demonstrated experimentally
 with photons,[10][11] neutrinos,[12] electrons,[13][14] molecules as large as buckyballs,[15][16] and even small diamonds.[17][18]
 The utilization of entanglement in communication, computation and quantum radar is a very active area of research and development.
